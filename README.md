# Zipcode-search
A convenient and efficient zip code look up applet. It can search a zip code given a U.S. location, search a location given a zip code, or even plot all zip codes on a U.S. map. Except for the map part, all the rest is written in Java and implemented with static arrays, Binary Search Tree, or JOPtionPane. In the future I may make it as a real Android application.
